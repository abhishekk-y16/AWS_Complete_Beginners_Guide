# Backup Strategy

TL;DR
- Define RTO/RPO, tier data by criticality, automate backups, and test restores regularly.

Steps
1. Identify critical resources and recovery objectives.
2. Use AWS Backup for centralized policy management across services.
3. Implement cross-region replication for critical datasets.
4. Periodically test restores and document playbooks.

Checklist
- RTO/RPO documented, backup plans in AWS Backup, restore tests performed.
