# What is AWS? ☁️

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive cloud computing platform.

## Simple Definition

**AWS = Rent computers and services from Amazon instead of buying your own**

Instead of:
- ❌ Buying physical servers ($10,000+)
- ❌ Maintaining data centers
- ❌ Hiring IT staff
- ❌ Upgrading hardware every 3 years

You can:
- ✅ Rent servers by the hour ($0.01/hour)
- ✅ Amazon handles maintenance
- ✅ Scale up/down instantly
- ✅ Pay only for what you use

## What Can You Do with AWS?

### 1. Host Websites and Apps
```
Your website on AWS:
- No servers to buy
- Handles millions of visitors
- Scales automatically
- Costs start at $5/month
```

**Example:** Netflix runs entirely on AWS

### 2. Store Files and Data
```
S3 (Simple Storage Service):
- Store photos, videos, backups
- $0.023 per GB/month

### 3. Run Databases
